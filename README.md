# What’s DMN?
This modeling language created by OMG – an international group dedicated to developing technology standards – is a notation for business rules applied to processes.
DMN makes it so business rules can be transformed into corporate assets, making decision-making and understanding corporate rules easier, which ultimately ensures greater task effectiveness.
The importance of DMN lies in companies’ need to ensure daily activities are carried out to the letter – that is, in line with what was previously decided.
In that sense, DMN can turn complex business processes into easy-to-understand models, without omitting any essential rules, clarifying the path being taken for management as well as employees.
Use of DMN makes it possible for employees and decision-makers to reproduce the same initiatives across departments, optimize communication channels with customers, and improve internal and external analysis.
With the concept outlined, now let’s move on to how DMN is structured.
